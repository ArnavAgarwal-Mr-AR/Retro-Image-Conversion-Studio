In the early days of computing and gaming, before the advent of high-resolution graphics, images and graphics were often represented using ASCII characters. This technique, known as ASCII art, utilized the characters available on standard keyboards to create pictures and designs. Classic games and computer systems from the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Commodore 64 and early PCs, relied heavily on this method to display images due to the limited graphical capabilities of the hardware.
